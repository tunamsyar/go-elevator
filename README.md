# Go-Elevator

Inspired by the elevators in Mercu 2.

Elevator works by registering user/cards to authorized floors.

To call the elevators, user must tap card and select from a list of floors authorized

Elevator then has a fixed size array to store the floors in order.

Each floor arrived will pop out from the array.
